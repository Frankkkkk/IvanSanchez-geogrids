Javascript utilities for working with Global Discrete Geodetic Grids (GDGGs)


This software package implements two separate funcionalities:

* `gdgg`: Converting a location on the geoid to a numeric ID (and vice versa)
* `encoders`: Converting a numeric ID into a text string (and vice versa)

The API surface of the GDGGs and the encoders is written down in `src/gdgg/README.md` and `src/encoders/README.md`, respectively.

The available GDGGs and encoders can be seen in `src/api.js`.
